#Milestone 1 - Chatbot Design and Setup
1. The bot should be able to differentiate at least X different types of queries and give X different types of
responses, where X is the number of students in your group.
2. The bot should use a redis server to store some persistent information.
3. The bot should use consume another service other than redis.
4. The bot should be running on Heroku, or an equivalent cloud.
5. The design concept of the bot should be applicable to our society while the content (e.g. answer of
questions, reported data) need not to be accurate, most updated, nor comprehensive.
6. The bot should use git for version controls.
7. The LINE bot should be written only with Python and its library.
8. The web bot should be written only with Python and its library at back-end, while using Javascript +
HTML5 at frontend. The frontend code (i.e. the html and js) should NOT be placed on the server.
