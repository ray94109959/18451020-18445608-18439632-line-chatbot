   - In response to this ongoing public health emergency, our team would like to develop a Line Chatbot for public enquiries regarding â€œCOVID-19. Using this chatbot, user could easily use their mobile to track the following hot items in real-time.

   - We will create 3 type of chatbot categories:
      ### Type of Queries 
            * Goods (e.g Mask Inventory)
               * The Shop or Pharmacy to purchase goods
               * Hong Kong Mask Inventory

            * COVID-19 News
               * News headline & Content
               * aggregate differnt media source 

            * Confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection in Hong Kong
               * Number of confirmed case 
               * Number of recovered case
